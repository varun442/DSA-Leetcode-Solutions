Very similar to - https://github.com/varun442/DSA-Leetcode-Solutions/blob/main/Search%20in%20Infinite%20Array%20(BS)

Combination of two diffrent problems -> Index of an element in infinite array + first occurence of an element 

findElement(inr arr[], int key){
  int low=0;
  int high=1;
  while(key<arr[high]){
    low=high;
    high=high*2;
  }
  return firstOccurenceUsingBinarySearch(arr[], key, low, high)
}

  int res=-1;
